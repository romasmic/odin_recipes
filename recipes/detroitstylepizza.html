<h1>Detroit Style Pizza</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of our newest obsessions is Detroit-style pizza, a dish born at Buddy's Rendezvous (later to become Buddy's Pizza) in that city more than 70 years ago. Known for its thick crust with crackly-crisp sides and bottom, it also layers classic pizza toppings in reverse order: first optional pepperoni, then cheese (brick cheese, to be totally traditional), then sauce. Itâ€™s baked in a special dark anodized pan to achieve perfectly crispy caramelized cheese around the edge; a harmonious balance to the soft, chewy crust, and sauce and gooey cheese on top.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup of Warm Water</li>
            <li>1 Package of Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of White Sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons of olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 1/2 Cups of Bread Flour</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Jar of Marinara Sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of Dried Oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Red Pepper Flakes</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of Garlic Powder</li>
        </ul>
<h3>Toppings:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces of shredded Mozzarella Cheese</li>
            <li>4 ounces of shredded Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>4 ounces of shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 500-550 degrees farenheit</li>
            <li>Add one cup of warm water to a mixing bowl and then pour in your package of active dry yeast. Wait a few minutes while that activates (some air bubbles will form and it will begin to smell), then add in 1tsp of white sugar, 1tsp of kosher salt, 3tsp of olive oil, and finally 2 1/2 cups of bread flour. While using the dough hook attachment, run your stand mixer on low-medium speed until the dough comes together into a ball. If the dough is too dry, add a teaspoon of water at a time until it comes together.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from mixing bowl and place it in a roasting pan that has been generously coated in olive oil. With oiled fingertips slightly knead the dough into a rectangular shape but not all the way to the edges of the pan. Cover pan with plastic wrap and let dough rise for an hour.</li>
            <li>While the dough is rising we can begin simmering the sauce. Add one jar of marinara sauce to a small saucepan, then add in two Tablespoons of dried oregano, one teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and one teaspoon of garlic powder. Mix it until it is well combined, then heat it up on a burner set to medium until it starts to bubble, then reduce heat to low and let sit until we need it, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>After an hour the dough should have risen enough to allow you to knead it to the edges. With oily fingertips gently knead the dough to fill the pan and about an inch or two up the sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your mozzarella, parmesan, and cheddar cheeses all over the dough, making sure to get a generous amount along the edges of the pizza to make a delicious fried cheese crust.</li>
            <li>Pour your sauce in two horizontal lines.</li>
            <li>Transfer to oven and cook for 15-20 minutes or until crust is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let sit for ten minutes and then slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
